A comprehensive collection of Python and Bash automation scripts for AWS resource management, monitoring, security, and cost optimization.

## üöÄ Overview

This toolkit provides powerful automation scripts to help AWS administrators and developers manage their cloud resources more efficiently. The scripts are organized into categories based on their functionality:

- **Resource Management**: Scripts for creating, configuring, and cleaning up AWS resources
- **Monitoring**: Tools for setting up CloudWatch dashboards, alarms, and log analysis
- **Security**: Scripts for auditing IAM users, analyzing security groups, and finding public resources
- **Cost Optimization**: Tools for rightsizing resources and optimizing AWS costs
- **Networking**: Scripts for managing VPCs, subnets, and network configurations
- **Backup & Recovery**: Tools for automating backups and implementing disaster recovery

## üìã Tools Overview

| `reserved_instance_analyzer.py` | Analyzes EC2 usage patterns and recommends Reserved Instance purchases |
| `savings_plan_analyzer.py` | Analyzes compute usage and recommends Savings Plan purchases |
| `cost_anomaly_detector.py` | Detects unusual spending patterns and sends alerts |
| `idle_resource_finder.sh` | Identifies idle or unused resources that can be terminated |
| `cost_allocation_tagger.py` | Helps implement and enforce cost allocation tagging strategies |

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Installation

These scripts require the AWS CLI and Python 3.6+ with boto3 installed.

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip3 install boto3 tabulate colorama matplotlib pandas

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/x0VIER/aws-toolkit.git
cd aws-toolkit

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x */*.py */*.sh
```

### Configuration

The scripts use the AWS credentials and configuration from your environment. You can specify a profile or region when running the scripts.

```bash
# Configure AWS CLI if not already done
aws configure
```

### Usage Examples

#### Resource Rightsizer

```bash
# Analyze all resources
./cost-optimization/resource_rightsizer.py --service all

# Export results to HTML report
./cost-optimization/resource_rightsizer.py --export report.html --export-format html
```

#### Public Resource Finder

```bash
# Find all public resources
./security/public_resource_finder.py

# Find specific public resources
./security/public_resource_finder.py --service s3
```

#### CloudWatch Dashboard Creator

```bash
# Create an EC2 dashboard
./monitoring/cloudwatch_dashboard_creator.py --type ec2 --name my-ec2-dashboard
```

## üìã Prerequisites

- AWS account with administrator access
- Python 3.6 or higher
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Required Python packages: boto3, tabulate, colorama, matplotlib, pandas

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Some scripts may make changes to your AWS resources. Always review the script actions before running.
- Always test scripts in a non-production environment first.
- Scripts that analyze resources may incur AWS API charges if run frequently on large environments.
